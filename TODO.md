### ARCHITECTURE NOTES:

__Current State:__

- Daemon god class acknowledged (1,400+ lines)
- Integrations complete but not refactored
- System works but could be more maintainable

__Recommended Next Steps (Future Work):__

1. Extract focused service classes from daemon
2. Implement proper dependency injection
3. Add unit tests for new systems
4. Continue SOLID refactoring incrementally
